# PyBer_Challenge
# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of this PyBer analysis is to use the provided city and ride-share data to understand ride-share activity and usage by city type.  This analysis will provide insight to the CEOs to create strategies and future ride-share plans.

#Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
In analyzing the data, we determined there are 3 city types & the total rides for each:
Rural        125
Suburban     625
Urban       1625

You'll notice that Urban areas have the most rides and drivers.
Rural         78
Suburban     490
Urban       2405

Let's now dig into the ride share averages to understand the disparities between the 3 city types.  While Urban areas have the most rides and drivers, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest. 


#Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Based on the given data, to address the disparities among the city types, I'd recommend the following:
    1. To dive deeper into the true disparities, track ride start and end times.  This will really show the profitability amongst the city types.
    2. All 3 cities have peaks when ride-share drastically increase then plummet, if we drill into the below line chart we may notice that weekend ride share increase, then plummets at the start of the week.
    3. Final recommendation, during the first of the year to mid-February hire less drivers or part-time drivers, mid-February to April; ride-sharing is more in-demand; so consider hiring more weekend drivers.
